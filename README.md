# Full stack project

## Email service

This project use ReactJS to frontend and use Laravel framework to Backend service.

- frontend ReactJs hosting with Netlify.
- backend Laravel hosting with DigitalOcean.

### problem

1. Almost all email services require domain verification to work. So I solved the problem by buying a domain and email to apply for an email service.

2. The email provider verified and verified the account to provide the API service, on the first day I used the API service without any issues but the next day my account was closed for no reason. Makes my service only one left out of two service.

### function
